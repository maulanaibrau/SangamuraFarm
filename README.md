## How to Run This Project

Sangamura Farm is a data visualization project featuring a Shiny app designed to help users explore and analyze key environmental metrics collected from the farm. The application provides interactive dashboards and visualizations for:

- **Temperature**
- **Humidity**
- **Rainfall**
- **Light Intensity**
- **Atmospheric Pressure**
- **Wind Speed and Direction**

With these features, users can monitor trends, compare data over time, and gain insights into the farm's environmental conditions. The intuitive interface makes it easy to visualize complex datasets, supporting better decision-making for farm management and research.
